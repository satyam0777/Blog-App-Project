##  Why I Built This

In today’s digital world, **content is power** — and developers, writers, and entrepreneurs often need a personal space to express their ideas.

I built this **Blog App** to:

- ✅ Practice **authentication**, **CRUD operations**, and **state management**
- ✅ Create a project that mimics real-world blogging and CMS use cases
- ✅ Build a foundation for future upgrades like Markdown support or a WYSIWYG editor

This app is more than a clone — it's a learning project crafted to implement **clean code**, responsive design, and a modular backend structure.
